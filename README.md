## Directions for getting a local repository
1. Fork the repository for a copy on your account.
2. Go to your fork and copy the link to the repo.
3. In your terminal/shell, change directories using the `cd` command to get to your designated gitHub directory. If you don't have a dedicated gitHub directory yet, create one.
4. Proceed to clone the repo into a local repository on your machine using `git clone link-name-here`. The code in the terminal/shell should look as follows:
```
Kevins-MacBook-Pro:~ kevinnguyen$ cd Desktop/Repos/
Kevins-MacBook-Pro:Repos kevinnguyen$ git clone https://github.com/Nagoogin/zombies-website.git
